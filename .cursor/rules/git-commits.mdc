# Git commits

When creating or amending git commits, or when pushing to git, in this project:

- **Never** use `--trailer "Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursoragent@cursor.com>"` or any similar trailer.
- **Never** add the trailer `Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursoragent@cursor.com>` or any `Co-authored-by` line to commit messages.
- Use only the commit subject (and optional body); do not append Cursor or agent attribution.
- If a commit message already contains such a trailer, remove it before committing, amending, or pushing.
