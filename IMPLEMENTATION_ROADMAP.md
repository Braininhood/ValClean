# VALClean Booking System - Detailed Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This document provides a **step-by-step implementation guide** for building the VALClean booking system. Each phase includes detailed tasks, acceptance criteria, and deliverables.

### Supabase (current stack)

**VALClean now uses Supabase.** Keep this in mind across the roadmap:

| Supabase service | Use in VALClean |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Database** | PostgreSQL hosted on Supabase. Django connects via `DATABASE_URL`. All app tables (users, orders, appointments, etc.) live here. |
| **Auth (optional)** | Supabase Auth for sign-in/sign-up; Google OAuth enabled in Dashboard. Frontend: `lib/supabase/client.ts`, `useSupabaseAuth`. |
| **Storage (optional)** | File uploads (e.g. avatars, service images) can use Supabase Storage; backend: `apps.core.supabase_storage`. |
| **Edge Functions (optional)** | Serverless tasks (e.g. webhooks, calendar sync) without running everything in Django/Celery. |

- **Setup:** See **[SUPABASE_SETUP.md](./SUPABASE_SETUP.md)** for database connection, migrations, RLS, seed data, and env vars.
- **Reuse where it fits:** OAuth (Google/Microsoft) for Auth and calendar, DB for all state, Storage for files, Edge Functions for background jobs.

#### Day 4-5: Multi-Calendar Integration (All Roles)

**Note: We now work with Supabase.** Use Supabase where it fits to avoid duplicating work:
- **Supabase Auth → OAuth (callback URL):**  
  **Callback URL (for OAuth):** `https://[PROJECT_REF].supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`  
  Example: `https://lonmjafmvdvzevaggwem.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`  
  Configure this in [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard) → Authentication → URL Configuration, and in each provider (Google, etc.) as the redirect URI.
- **Supabase Auth → OAuth providers:** Enable Google in Dashboard → Authentication → Providers. **Microsoft (Azure AD / Outlook):** *Temporarily unavailable – waiting for customer access.* Reuse Google OAuth for calendar where possible (e.g. same token for Auth + Calendar scope).
- **Supabase Database:** Calendar connection state (tokens, refresh tokens, provider, user link) lives in our Django models/tables already in Supabase (e.g. `calendar_sync` or profile-related tables).
- **Supabase Edge Functions** (optional): For serverless calendar sync (e.g. webhook handlers, background sync) if we don’t want to run everything in Django/Celery.
- **Supabase Storage** (optional): Store .ics files or export artifacts if needed.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Set up Google Calendar API (use Supabase Google OAuth; callback URL above)
- [ ] Microsoft Graph API (Outlook): *Paused until customer provides access*
- [ ] Set up Apple Calendar (iCal/CalDAV)
- [ ] OAuth 2.0 flow for Google (Supabase callback); Outlook when available

- [ ] Calendar connection UI for all roles
- [ ] Create calendar event on booking (auto-sync)
- [ ] Update calendar event on changes
- [ ] Delete calendar event on cancellation
- [ ] Add custom events to external calendars (all roles)
- [ ] **Order confirmation page: "Add booking to calendar"** (download .ics, Add to Google Calendar)
- [ ] Two-way sync (optional)
- [ ] Calendar sync status dashboard
- [ ] Bulk sync operations (admin)
- [ ] Download .ics files

**Deliverables:**
- Google Calendar sync (all roles)

**Deliverables:**
- Google Places address autocomplete

**Verification (double-checked):**
- **Backend:** `GET /api/addr/autocomplete/?query=...` and `GET|POST /api/addr/validate/?place_id=...` or `?postcode=...` (see `backend/apps/core/views_address.py`, `backend/apps/core/address.py`). UK-only (`country:gb`). Requires `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` in `backend/.env`; enable **Places API** and **Geocoding API** in Google Cloud.
- **Frontend:** Booking details page (`frontend/app/booking/details/page.tsx`) uses autocomplete → on select calls validate with `place_id` → populates address line1, line2, city, postcode, country. Manual fields and fallback if no results or API key missing.
- **Flow:** Type address/postcode → suggestions from backend → select → validate returns full address → form filled; user can edit. Without API key, autocomplete returns empty and user can enter address manually.

#### Day 3-4: Email Notifications (Google Gmail + Supabase)

**Stack:** **Google Gmail SMTP** for sending (Django); optional **Supabase Edge Functions** or **pg_cron** for reminder cron. Configure in `backend/.env`: `EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com`, `EMAIL_HOST_USER`, `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` (use [Google App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833)), `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`. See `backend/.env.example`.

### Week 11: Route Optimization & Advanced Calendar

#### Day 1-2: Route Optimization
**Tasks:**
- [x] Google Maps integration (Geocoding + Distance Matrix API; map on frontend via NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY)
- [x] Distance calculation (Distance Matrix API in `backend/apps/core/route_utils.py`)
- [x] Route optimization algorithm (greedy nearest-neighbour in `route_utils.optimize_route_greedy`)
- [x] Multi-stop routing (POST `/api/ad/routes/optimize/`; GET `/api/ad/routes/staff-day/` for staff+date)
- [x] Route visualization (markers + polyline on map at `/ad/routes`)
- [x] Estimated travel time (per-leg and total in response; displayed on page)

**Deliverables:**
- Route optimization (`/ad/routes`: load staff day → edit stops → optimize → ordered list + map)
- Map visualization (Google Maps with numbered markers and polyline for optimized order)
- Travel time estimates (leg minutes and total minutes)

#### Day 3-4: Calendar Sync UI & Management
**Tasks:**
- [x] Calendar connection interface (all roles); store connection state in **Django models** (Profile)
- [x] Calendar sync settings page (`/settings/calendar` for all roles)
- [x] Sync status indicators (last_sync_at, last_sync_error in status + UI)
- [x] Manual sync trigger (POST `/api/calendar/sync/`)
- [x] Bulk sync operations (admin) (POST `/api/calendar/sync-bulk/`; UI at `/ad/settings/calendar`)
- [x] Custom event creation UI (form on settings page; POST `/api/calendar/events/`)
- [x] Calendar event management (GET `/api/calendar/events/` lists synced appointments)
- [x] Sync error handling and retry (last_sync_error stored; manual "Sync now" retry)
- [ ] **Optional:** Supabase Edge Functions for serverless sync jobs

**Deliverables:**
- Calendar sync UI for all roles
- Sync management dashboard
- Custom event creation
- Error handling

#### Day 5: Calendar Sync Testing & Optimization
**Tasks:**
- [x] Test calendar sync for all roles (backend tests in `apps/calendar_sync/tests.py`: status, manual sync, bulk sync; Staff/Customer paths covered; Admin/Manager use bulk or settings)
- [x] Test custom event creation (API validation tests: POST without start/end returns 400; GET events returns 200 with `events` array)
- [ ] Test two-way sync (if enabled) — **not in scope**: current design is one-way (VALClean → external calendar only)
- [x] Performance optimization (sync is per-user, batch of appointments; acceptable for typical load; no N+1 in list)
- [x] Error recovery mechanisms (`last_sync_error` stored in Profile; "Sync now" retry; UI shows error; friendlier message when all events fail: "Try syncing again or reconnect your calendar")
- [ ] Sync conflict resolution — **future**: no merge of external calendar edits; conflicts not auto-resolved

**Deliverables:**
- Tested calendar sync system (`apps/calendar_sync/tests.py`)
- Optimized sync performance (per-user batch; error message on full failure)
- Error recovery (last_sync_error + retry + reconnect hint)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Route optimization saves time
- Calendar syncs work reliably for all roles (Staff, Customer, Manager, Admin)
- All calendar formats supported (Google, Outlook, Apple)
- Custom events can be added by all roles
- Sync errors handled gracefully

- **Payment Failures**: Multiple payment gateways and retry logic
- **Calendar Sync Issues**: Robust error handling and retry mechanisms
- **Third-Party API Failures**: Fallback options and graceful degradation

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Strict phase boundaries and change management
- **Resource Constraints**: Buffer time in each phase
- **Integration Challenges**: Early integration testing
- **Third-Party Delays**: Alternative solutions ready

### User Adoption Risks
- **Training**: Comprehensive documentation and training
- **Change Resistance**: User-friendly design and gradual rollout
- **Technical Barriers**: Simple, intuitive interface
- **Support**: Dedicated support during launch
